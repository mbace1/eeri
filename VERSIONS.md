# EERI — versions

## v2 — 2026-08-13
**The loop.** v1 had systems and no game: riding was strictly worse than
walking (45% slower, no jump, a five-times wider body), the boom was a
verb with no object, and the room had no reason to go right. v2 is the
answer, and it is the owner's: **a machine is dangerous until it is
yours, and the room is a lock the machine opens.**

The excavator now starts **unmanned** — amber beacon turning, working its
own slow dig cycle. It is not hunting Eeri; it is heavy and blind, and
standing under the bucket while it sweeps puts him down. The lift is the
window, so **mounting is the skill test**: read the cycle, take the step,
and the beacon goes out — the threat is now the tool, permanently.

The room is two obstacles, each shaped for exactly one of them. **The
pit** is kid-shaped: he clears it in a run, and the machine refuses a
cliff. **The bank** is machine-shaped: three tiles of dirt above his
jump, taken down a row at a time by holding the bucket in it. Digging
edits the **map**, not the picture, so the level really changed; the
bank's cut face and spill are drawn per state (`js/pieces.js`, behind the
same asset seam as everything else, contract `state0/1/2`). Walking out
through the gate the machine opened is SITE CLEAR.

Fixed on the way: a queued `action` press was consumed again the instant
riding began, so a player who mashed E climbed in and fell straight back
out — the same double-consume trap Suds Jack paid for, now drained at
both edges. The HUD moved to the top-right; it had been sitting under
`hub/shell.js`'s HOME button, unreadable, in every screenshot.

Gate: 49 checks.

## v1 — 2026-08-12
Gate-1 diorama slice, asset-ready. The full layer stack (sky / skyline /
far / mid / near / foreground occluders) as code-painted cutouts at real
z-depths behind a 24° long-lens camera; tile-grid level with collision
(ground, mounds, steel platforms, a pit, a girder); Eeri on foot (run /
buffered+coyote jump / hard-landing squash); the excavator as first mount
(E to climb in via the step, drive with heavy ease, W/S boom on real
hinges, hop out); 19 bolt spinners to collect; a depth-tinted background
excavator working a dig loop on the far layer; blob shadows, exhaust
puffs, touch buttons. **The asset seam is live:** `assets/manifest.json` +
`js/assets.js` — every model and 2D layer swaps from code placeholder to
PNG/GLB file with a one-word manifest edit against the node contracts in
`assets/README.md`.

The first hazard is in and it sets the pattern: a wrecking ball hangs dead
still until you come near, then **winds back** — chevrons pulsing, one
warning tone — and only then swings. Nothing here kills; the cost is the
**Yoshi rule**, a hit takes the RIDE (thrown clear of the cab) and never
the run, with mercy frames on foot. A synth kit carries it, including a
diesel bed whose pitch rises with the machine's load, and the arcade
cabinet (`worksite` cover), the way home and the Toko signature are
mounted. `prefers-reduced-motion` stills the decorative background
machine and holds the chevrons steady instead of flashing.

Not yet: more machines, more world themes, the level beyond one room.
