# EERI — versions

## v7 — 2026-08-13 — controller-first controls, the stomp, and the flag

**Three lineages became one.** The gameplay branch (parts kit, room prover,
crane, robots, brick wall) and the art branch (Meshy-rigged animated Eeri,
the pipeline) are reconciled into `main`, split by kind. Two regressions the
graft nearly shipped were caught: `kid.js` had reverted to a hardcoded fall
respawn, and the gate only understood the node contract so the skinned
character failed it.

**The painted layer art was unplugged, again.** `layers.js` imported
`assets.js?v=1` while `main.js` imported `?v=2` — two tokens, so the module
instantiated twice, `loadManifest()` ran on one instance and
`getLayerTexture()` asked the other. Every layer fell back to code-paint
while 2.7 MB of PNG sat unrequested. `palette.js` was split the same way.
Third time for this class, so it is gated now: a static sweep failing on any
module imported under two tokens, and a runtime check that every asset the
manifest calls **live** was actually FETCHED.

**Controls are controller-first** (DESIGN.md §5). `input.js` reads a pad
natively — polled once a frame, edge-detected against its own previous
state so an idle pad never clobbers a held key, and polled in every mode
rather than inside the play branch. Every prompt is glyphs and names no
key; the on-screen buttons wear the same glyphs. The touch layout is a
bottom row plus a boom pair: the d-pad cross tried first stood 200 px tall
on a landscape phone and shoved the hint into the middle of the picture.

**The stomp.** Landing on a small machine kills it and bounces 80% of a
jump — enough to chain, never enough to reach what a jump cannot, so no
room's proved reach budget is quietly broken by an enemy standing in it.
Tested before the lunge, so jumping at one is the right answer rather than
a gamble, and it does not also count as being hit.

**The flag** (DESIGN.md §4.2) replaces the plain exit gate. It builds in
three phases as Eeri closes — base plate, pole, cloth — a puff of smoke
each, and finishes by being **run past**: no button, no stopping on a mark.
Level 3 of a world flies a bigger one in a different colour. Behind the
asset seam like everything else (`phase0/1/2` + `pole`).

Gate: 144 checks, plus 29 in the room prover. Five of the new ones run in a
real landscape-phone context rather than a forced-visible desktop — the
badge check earned itself immediately by catching Ⓑ underneath the Toko
signature, the same collision v6 fixed once for jump.

## v6 — 2026-08-13
**The parts kit, and rooms that can be finished.** Rooms were a hand-drawn
grid plus half a dozen side-arrays that could disagree with it — the pit
was declared twice, the bank twice, and nothing anywhere checked that a
machine could actually reach the thing it was supposed to clear. That is
where "you get stuck pretty fast" came from.

`js/parts.js` is the palette, and it is the method flashprince already
proved, ported rather than copied. There a room is twenty by twelve
characters and `editor.js` paints it from a named brush strip, because
"the character IS the data". Eeri's rooms scroll and carry MACHINES, so a
room here is a LIST OF PARTS and each part declares its rules once: what
it stamps into the map, what it demands of whoever arrives, and which
verb removes it. `js/rooms.js` is the whole game as three such lists.

**And the piece flashprince never had.** Its level distances are measured
off a written budget — a running jump carries 3.7 tiles, so a 3-tile gap
goes and a 4-tile gap does not — but nothing checks a room against it;
you find out by playing. Eeri gets the budget as numbers computed off
`kid.js` rather than guessed (jump apex 12.6²/60 = **2.65 tiles**, so a
2-tile step goes and 3 does not; a run carries **4.85**, so a 4-tile gap
goes and 5 does not) AND the check. `test/rooms.mjs` walks every room
from spawn to exit in plain Node — no browser, the shape of gameoflife's
`check_levels.mjs` — and a room that cannot be finished fails the build.
It carries eight rooms broken on purpose, one way each, so a prover that
cannot fail cannot pass unnoticed: a step too tall, a gap too wide, a
lock with no machine, **a machine penned from its own job by a hole**,
an obstacle outside its machine's reach, a machine spawned off its own
track, a robot patrolling across a hole.

**Machines have an A-to-B track now**, declared per room, and the check
holds the room to it: the track may not be cut by a hole, and every
obstacle the machine is meant to clear must lie within arm's reach of
somewhere on it. That single rule is what stops the class of soft-lock.

**SITE 3 — the wall, and the third verb.** A wrecking crane
(`js/crane.js`), on the excavator's exact node contract so a live GLB
drops in behind the same check and the same paint map. The brief had this
machine down as a *hazard boss*; the owner's direction moves it, and it
is the game's thesis in one object — the ball that swings at you unmanned
is the ball you swing at the wall once the cab is yours. The brick wall
(`Wall` in `js/pieces.js`) is the third manipulable piece: intact →
cracked → rubble, honouring §5.1's rule that rubble is a different
silhouette and not a shorter wall, and its rows leave the MAP when it
comes down, the same honesty as the dig and the span.

**Small things to avoid** (`js/robots.js`). A robot patrols a span the
kit guarantees is floor, notices, winds up, then lunges — flashprince's
sentry clock compressed, so it is a reading test rather than a reflex
test. A steam vent breathes on a fixed clock with a lit collar before it
blows. The cost is the Yoshi rule, unchanged: a hit takes the RIDE, not
the run, and a machine drives straight over a robot.

**Touch, fixed.** The Toko badge sat on top of the jump button — inert
per the house rule, but covering the one control the game is played with;
on a coarse pointer it now clears the whole button row. And every hint
named keyboard keys to a thumb that has none, so there is a touch string
set: `◀ ▶ — RUN · ▲ — JUMP`.

Found on the way: `window.__eeri.exc` was captured once at boot, so after
a room change the handle still pointed at the machine you had left — the
test that placed the kid beside "the machine" was standing him next to
one in another room. It is a getter now.

Gate: 115 checks, plus 29 in `test/rooms.mjs` (21 over the real rooms,
8 proving the prover bites).

## v5 — 2026-08-13
**The art lands, and the game goes up on the floor.** The seam built in
v1 did its job: five layer paintings and the excavator swapped from code
placeholder to file with a status flip, and no game code changed to
accept them. The excavator GLB honours the rig contract exactly — every
contracted node present, and its rest pose, pivots and node translations
match the placeholder to three decimals, so `house.y = 0.86`, the 0.52
boom and the −1.35 stick all land where the code already reached for
them. Its `wheels` node ships without the child spinners the placeholder
had, so the wheels do not roll; everything else animates.

**Two house rules had to be enforced at the seam rather than assumed.**
The model arrived with five baked photo-texture materials at metallic
0.5 — and §3.2 makes "one palette, one material language" a make-or-break
rule, not a preference, precisely because the risk in a 2D/3D game is the
cast and the world reading as two different games. It rendered rust-brown
against a brown hoarding and stopped being safety yellow. So a model
entry may now carry a `paint` map (node → palette role) and `assets.js`
replaces its materials with flat palette colours, keeping every bit of
geometry and rig. The node contract was already enforced there; the
surface is now too. Omit `paint` to ship an asset's own materials.

The fore painting was composed against the **old** occluder rect
(y −1…5), which v4 corrected to −2…14 so a foreground can actually be
cropped by the top of the frame. `art-src/tools/recanvas-fore.mjs` moves
it onto the taller canvas **at the exact world position it was painted
for** — the same pixels, the same world units, simply with room above
them. Its sibling tool pinned an absolute path into a scratch directory
and stopped working when that session ended; this one resolves playwright
through CJS instead, since ESM does not honour `NODE_PATH`.

**Deployed.** The cabinet was lit on the hub and pointed at `eeri/`,
which did not exist on `gh-pages` — Play was a 404. The game, the
catalogue entry and the `worksite` marquee are on the site now, merged
into the site's own `games.js`/`art.js` rather than overwriting them
(the site carries `tokotrip`, which this branch does not, and an
overwrite deletes a cabinet). `deploy-hub.mjs` renumbered every token
from one map, and its guard caught that the site's `hub.js` had grown a
WebXR floor sort this branch never had — brought back before deploying,
or the deploy would have deleted it.

**The textures the model never showed are gone.** Every one of its five
textured materials is covered by the paint map, so those images were
bytes the browser downloaded, decoded into blob URLs and threw away —
and each was an async load still in flight when the hub gate opened the
game and moved on, which is how they were found: a `Couldn't load
texture blob:` error that only Eeri produced.
`art-src/tools/strip-textures.mjs` removes them and compacts the buffer;
it refuses to run if any textured material is NOT repainted, since then
stripping would change what is on screen. Geometry, tri count, node
names, rest pose and pivots are untouched, and the frame is
pixel-identical. 924 → 851 KB.

Known, and the asset producer's call: at 851 KB and 8 740 triangles the
excavator is over the brief's ceilings (400 KB, and 3 000 tris for a
small machine / 6 000 for a big set-piece) — the weight is geometry, not
textures, so it wants decimating rather than re-exporting. Its `wheels`
node has no child spinners, so the wheels do not roll. And the fore
painting still sits below the playfield ground line, so it reads as a
band along the bottom rather than something you pass behind.

Gate: 98 checks, plus 13 against the deployed tree.

## v4 — 2026-08-13
**The depth pass — the Tropical Freeze half, which needs no cast.** The
3D characters are blocked on the Meshy pipeline, so this version moves
the other half of the confirmed reference pair: "2D gameplay, fully 3D
layered world — dramatic depth, the camera drifting on rails, background
layers where things happen, heavy-object weight." None of that needs a
model. It was judged the way the method says — render, LOOK, name what is
wrong, redo — and the LOOK named three things:

**A third of every frame was dead flat brown.** The earth below the lip
was one unbroken slab: the largest area on screen carrying no
information, which is the one thing the reference never does. It is a
cut section now — strata darkening downward, cobbles embedded in the
face, a fresh cut edge drawn either side of every hole, and a hard
shadow under the grass lip, because the lane the game is played on was a
0.14-tile hairline against a flat wall. The bank bands the same way; it
is the room's most important object and it read as a box.

**The occluder lane was buried.** Its rect stopped at y=5 — one tile
above the ground line — so a foreground piece physically could not reach
the top of the frame, and the one girder in it floated inside the dirt.
The "cropped foreground = depth" lesson was written in the brief and
absent from the screen. The rect runs −2…14 now, the whole visible band
at that depth, and carries a real kit: scaffold standards you pass
behind, spoil sweeping the bottom edge, a pipe run crossing above
everything. Two things it got wrong first and the README now states: a
big shape parked at eye level is a blob with the game hidden behind it
(the cable drums were 1.25-unit discs at head height), and a heap whose
crest sits below the playfield's ground line reads as a hole cut in the
earth rather than a mound in front of it.

**The background competed instead of receding.** A haze band sits the far
stack in air, and the skyline lost its internal contrast — crisp two-tone
blocks at that distance read as near and fought the playfield.

Plus the two things the reference has that a spring does not.
**`js/camera.js` is a director**: a site declares SHOTS — zones with
their own dolly, height and lead — and the camera blends across them, so
a room pulls back where it is asking you to read a lock and closes in
where it is not. Over that sit a slow **drift**, so the frame is never
dead still, and a **punch** — a short dolly kick on the dig, the sling,
the span seating and every hit, which is what weight looks like from
behind a camera. And **the background works**: a crane traverses a load
across the skyline and a truck crosses the far road, where before one
digging machine was one event in ninety-six tiles.

**The seam, hardened, because asset input has started.** Art contributes
files to `assets/` and a status flip, nothing else — so the gate now
refuses a manifest path that climbs out of that folder, and measures a
live PNG's pixels against its documented size rather than letting it
stretch silently onto the plane. The size table in `assets/README.md` is
the brief an artist paints to, so it is checked against `LAYER_RECTS` ×
`PPU` in code rather than trusted to have been kept up by hand. Both
guards were verified by feeding the gate bad input and watching it fail.

Gate: 93 checks.

## v3 — 2026-08-13
**The level beyond one room.** Walking through the gate now leads
somewhere: sites are data (`SITES` in `js/level.js` — map, bolts, spawns,
exit, and which lock the room carries), one `buildSite()` builds a room
into a single group and tears the old one down whole, the kid and the
machine persist, and the camera **cuts** to the new room — a slow pan
across a rebuilt world is a lie about geography. Each room's machine
starts unmanned again: taming does not carry between sites, so the mount
is read every time, which is the point of it.

Site 2 is **the girder** — the second manipulable piece, its contract
already waiting in the manifest: stacked → slung → seated as a span. The
gap is eight tiles, past *both* of them — the kid's jump falls short and
the machine refuses the cliff. The same gesture as the dig works it the
other way round: hold the bucket in the stack and the chains take the
load (the machine drives at ×0.55 while carrying — a machine earns its
slowness); lower it at the lip and the span seats, filling the MAP row
the way the dig cleared one, so the bridged gap is a fact about the
level. The kid crosses on foot, because the exit is his half of the job.

Found by LOOKING, not by the gate: a slung load hung a fixed length
under the bucket and **sank into the ground** when the boom came down —
now the chains go slack and the load rests, never sinks (the rest depth
is measured off the asset's own bounding box, so a live GLB keeps the
behaviour). Found the flaky way: the GPU-less sandbox runs the clock
~5× slow, so a mount that takes 0.55 s of game time takes ~3 s of wall
clock — the test's retry loop now walks back up and gives each attempt
real time, and the crossing is asserted mid-span instead of demanding a
36-tile walk inside a wall-clock timeout.

Gate: 65 checks.

## v2 — 2026-08-13
**The loop.** v1 had systems and no game: riding was strictly worse than
walking (45% slower, no jump, a five-times wider body), the boom was a
verb with no object, and the room had no reason to go right. v2 is the
answer, and it is the owner's: **a machine is dangerous until it is
yours, and the room is a lock the machine opens.**

The excavator now starts **unmanned** — amber beacon turning, working its
own slow dig cycle. It is not hunting Eeri; it is heavy and blind, and
standing under the bucket while it sweeps puts him down. The lift is the
window, so **mounting is the skill test**: read the cycle, take the step,
and the beacon goes out — the threat is now the tool, permanently.

The room is two obstacles, each shaped for exactly one of them. **The
pit** is kid-shaped: he clears it in a run, and the machine refuses a
cliff. **The bank** is machine-shaped: three tiles of dirt above his
jump, taken down a row at a time by holding the bucket in it. Digging
edits the **map**, not the picture, so the level really changed; the
bank's cut face and spill are drawn per state (`js/pieces.js`, behind the
same asset seam as everything else, contract `state0/1/2`). Walking out
through the gate the machine opened is SITE CLEAR.

Fixed on the way: a queued `action` press was consumed again the instant
riding began, so a player who mashed E climbed in and fell straight back
out — the same double-consume trap Suds Jack paid for, now drained at
both edges. The HUD moved to the top-right; it had been sitting under
`hub/shell.js`'s HOME button, unreadable, in every screenshot.

Gate: 49 checks.

## v1 — 2026-08-12
Gate-1 diorama slice, asset-ready. The full layer stack (sky / skyline /
far / mid / near / foreground occluders) as code-painted cutouts at real
z-depths behind a 24° long-lens camera; tile-grid level with collision
(ground, mounds, steel platforms, a pit, a girder); Eeri on foot (run /
buffered+coyote jump / hard-landing squash); the excavator as first mount
(E to climb in via the step, drive with heavy ease, W/S boom on real
hinges, hop out); 19 bolt spinners to collect; a depth-tinted background
excavator working a dig loop on the far layer; blob shadows, exhaust
puffs, touch buttons. **The asset seam is live:** `assets/manifest.json` +
`js/assets.js` — every model and 2D layer swaps from code placeholder to
PNG/GLB file with a one-word manifest edit against the node contracts in
`assets/README.md`.

The first hazard is in and it sets the pattern: a wrecking ball hangs dead
still until you come near, then **winds back** — chevrons pulsing, one
warning tone — and only then swings. Nothing here kills; the cost is the
**Yoshi rule**, a hit takes the RIDE (thrown clear of the cab) and never
the run, with mercy frames on foot. A synth kit carries it, including a
diesel bed whose pitch rises with the machine's load, and the arcade
cabinet (`worksite` cover), the way home and the Toko signature are
mounted. `prefers-reduced-motion` stills the decorative background
machine and holds the chevrons steady instead of flashing.

Not yet: more machines, more world themes, the level beyond one room.
