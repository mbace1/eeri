// EERI — SCENERY AS DATA, which is the thing standing between this game and
// an editor.
//
// The levels have been data since parts.js: a room is a list of parts, the
// prover reads it, and spec/eeri.json now hands all twelve to the Godot
// port. Scenery never was. A prop is a call inside a function body —
//
//     pipeStack(7.2, 3.65, 0.82);
//
// — which is why dev/inspector.js can point at a prop and drag it but
// cannot SAVE: there is nowhere to write to, and no way to say WHICH call
// made the thing under your finger. Its own header says as much, and calls
// saving "step 2, and it is the real work".
//
// This is that step, and it is deliberately not an editor feature. The
// builders stay exactly where they are — they are the art lane's
// vocabulary and this file does not touch a single shape. What moves is
// the PLACEMENT: the twenty calls at the bottom of a dressing module
// become twenty rows here, each naming a prop type and its numbers.
//
// Three things fall out of that, and they are the three the owner asked
// for:
//
//   · the inspector can name the row that made a thing, so a drag has
//     somewhere to be written back to;
//   · a LIGHT is then not a new system — it is a prop type with a colour
//     and a radius, placed by the same tool, saved to the same row;
//   · the Godot port gets scenery through the spec it already reads,
//     rather than by someone re-typing coordinates.
//
// FORMAT. A row is `{ prop, x, y, ...fields }`. `PROPS` below declares
// which fields each type carries and what they mean, because an editor
// that has to guess is an editor that shows eight unlabelled numbers —
// which is the loop we are getting away from.

// ---- the vocabulary ------------------------------------------------------
// One entry per prop type: the fields it takes beyond x/y, each with a
// sensible default and a step for a slider. `label` is what a person is
