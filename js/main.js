// EERI — orchestration: scene, camera, the mode machine (foot / mount /
// riding / dismount), sites, bolts, HUD. Owns no art: characters come from
// the asset seam, the environment from layers.js, the rooms from level.js.
//
// v3: the level goes beyond one room. Everything a room owns — map meshes,
// gate, bolts, the lock piece, the hazard — lives in one group built by
// buildSite() and torn down whole; the kid, the machine models and the
// diorama persist. Walking out of a site's gate loads the next one, and
// only the last gate says SITE CLEAR.
