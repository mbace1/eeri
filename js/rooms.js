// EERI — the levels.
//
// Every room is a list of known-good pieces from js/parts.js, and nothing
// here restates a rule: a pit knows it is a hole and that a machine will not
// drive into one, a ladder knows it needs a foot and a landing, a bank knows
// it needs a bucket. `check()` walks each of these against the kid's real
// reach budget, so a room that cannot be finished — or a bolt that cannot be
// had — fails `test/rooms.mjs` rather than stranding somebody halfway.
//
// THE SHAPE OF A LEVEL (DESIGN §4, the owner's Mario/Yoshi direction), and
// it is why these three rooms are laid out the way they are:
//
//   ONE IDEA PER LEVEL, IN FOUR BEATS. Introduce it alone and safe · vary
//   it · combine it with something already known · test it once, at the
//   peak. A level that introduces two ideas is two levels.
//
// The beats are marked below because the marks are the only thing that
// stops beat 2 quietly becoming another beat 1. The RIDE sits at beat 3–4,
// in the back half — `check()` enforces that much, since a ride that opens
// a level is a level whose peak is its first minute.
//
// What each level teaches:
//   1 — THE STOMP. Small things you land on. Nothing else is new.
//   2 — THE CLIMB. Ladders and decks; the room stops being a corridor.
//   3 — BOTH, and the crane. The big one, and the world's own ending.
