// EERI — what a level is CALLED, and what its address is.
//
// The game runs on one flat index: `SITES[i]`, and `goSite(i + 1)` is the
// whole of "next level". That is right, and nothing here changes it — a
// world is a NAMING layer over the flat list, not a second data structure.
// Two lists that can disagree is the bug this project has already paid for
// more than once (SITES vs ROOMS, and the three "v11" lineages).
//
// The scheme is Mario's, because the owner asked for it and because it is
// the one every parent already reads: EERI 1-1 is the first level of the
// first world, EERI 1-2 the second, EERI 2-1 the first level of world two.
// DESIGN §4.1 fixes a world at THREE levels, growing 3 → 6 → 9 → 12, so the
// mapping is arithmetic and stays correct as rooms are added — a level never
// has to be told which world it is in.
//
// PURE except for the temporary greybox registration below. World 3/4 are
// intentionally kept outside the already-stable rooms.js while they are
// being playtested; world34-register.js appends them to the same live array
// that level.js exports. Fold them into rooms.js and remove this import once
// the six layouts stop moving.

// typing it: `#eeri-1-2`, `#EERI-1-2`, `#1-2`, `eeri-1-2`, with or without
// the `#`, all mean the same level. Anything else is null and the caller
// falls back to the first level rather than to a black screen.
