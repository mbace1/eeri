// EERI — the CRAFT MATERIAL FACTORY.
//
// Crafted World is a KIT of materials, not one material: corrugated card,
// wool felt, painted balsa, paper tube, cotton, tape, split pins. The game's
// surfaces should each be made of the thing they would really be made of.
//
// This exists because the first attempt wired the card map into `level.js`
// alone, and a probe of the live scene found the truth: three materials had
// a map and **seventy-odd did not**. Every module had grown its own
// `const M = (c) => new THREE.MeshLambertMaterial({ color: c })` — level,
// pieces, excavator, crane, hazards, robots, main — so the grass lip, every
// playfield cell, both machines and all the props were still flat paint
// while the ground behind them was card. Patching each call site would have
// left the next one to be written flat again.
//
// So: ONE factory. `craftMat(colour, material)` is the only way a surface is
// made, and it carries three things a bare material cannot:
//
//  1. the MAP arrives late and centrally — the texture is fetched once per
//     material name and applied to every material that asked for it, so a
//     scene is playable in flat palette colour and gains its craft when the
//     images land. A texture must never delay a level build.
//  2. the map is greyscale and MULTIPLIES the palette colour (§3.2 — "one
//     palette, no asset invents a colour"). The colour is still the
//     palette's; the material only modulates it.
//  3. world-space UV density, via `craftBox`. BoxGeometry maps 0…1 across
//     every face whatever its size, so one shared material stretched the
//     card over a 136-unit earth band and squashed it onto a 1-unit cell —
//     it read as streaking rather than as card.
//
// Adding a material is a manifest entry plus a name here. Nothing else.

import * as THREE from 'three';
import { getTexture } from './assets.js?v=14';

// world units per texture repeat, per material — a felt nap is fine and a
// card flute is coarse, so they do not share a scale
// A flute ripple is ~0.2 world units, so `flute` is dense; card liner is
// coarse; felt nap is fine. These are not interchangeable — one shared
// density made three materials look like one blurry material.
const DENSITY = { card: 1 / 5, felt: 1 / 1.6, balsa: 1 / 2.4, flute: 1 / 2.6 };
