// EERI — LIGHT, and the reason it is a prop and not a system.
//
// The diorama is UNLIT. `layers.js` mounts every lane as a
// `MeshBasicMaterial` with a texture map, so no light in the scene touches
// a backdrop; the kid and the machines are the only things under the
// `DirectionalLight`. That is the fact that decides what "add light
// sources" can mean here, and it turns out to be good news: the two
// cheapest options are also the two that need no new art, which matters
// because the art lane is the queue everything else is waiting behind.
//
// **1 · MOOD** — a `MeshBasicMaterial`'s `.color` MULTIPLIES its map, and
// it is white by default. So tinting a lane costs one assignment and no
// draw call: warm toward the camera, cool into the distance, and a night
// world can be a night world without a single repainted PNG. This is the
// thing that stops "dusk" being a palette swap.
//
// **2 · LAMPS** — one radial-gradient quad, additively blended, sitting at
// a z BETWEEN two lanes. Occlusion comes for free from the layer order: a
// lamp behind the near lane is behind it. This is the oldest trick in 2D
// lighting and it is the right one here, because it gives a light an
// (x, y) — which is exactly what the editor needs in order to place one.
//
// What is deliberately NOT here: normal maps. They are the correct answer
// for a light that moves across a surface, and they cost a new authored
// map per lane before one pixel changes — and normal-maps-on-parallax is a
// known rough edge in engines that do it natively, so it is also the
// option that would cost the Godot port a week. Rim-from-alpha is the
// next step up and it comes after there are lights worth rimming.
