// EERI — Worlds 3 and 4 greybox rooms.
//
// These six rooms deliberately spend ONLY mechanics already proved by Worlds
// 1-2 and the Gizmo Lab. The eventual World-3 cherry-picker / World-4 light
// rig can replace the familiar machine proxies later without holding up the
// thing we need now: six addressable, finishable layouts to playtest.
//
// World 3 = FOREST CLEARING AND DIGS: vertical, springy, timber/root rhythm.
// World 4 = EVENING SITE UNDER LIGHTS: belts, work decks and a final full-kit
// exam. Visual identity is a separate, non-collision dressing layer.
//
// THE RIDES ARE THESE WORLDS' OWN NOW (v15.28). They were excavator proxies
// — the note above said "the eventual cherry-picker / light rig can replace
// the familiar machine proxies later", and later is here. World 3 rides the
// SKIDDER (tracked, a grapple, a stack that clears the canopy) and World 4
// the LOADER (wheeled, a wide blade, work lamps on a mast). Both keep the
// excavator's verbs and its node contract, so nothing about these rooms'
// beats or budgets moved: what changed is that a forest clearing is no
// longer being worked by a yellow digger borrowed from level 1.

// THE TRAIL IS THE LEVEL TALKING, so it cannot be the same trail in six
// levels. What was here was four quiet 25-bolt blocks — 100 exactly, laid at
// columns 6-79 in every room whatever stood there. It was honest greybox
// scaffolding and it did the job it was for (route and beat shape first), but
// it left the bolts saying nothing: hanging over pits, ignoring every shelf
// the level wants you standing on, and stopping dead at column 79 so the
// whole ride beat was bare.
//
// Each room now lays its own, to the rules Level 1 set:
//
//   * a RUN out of the gate — the level saying which way it goes before it
//     asks you for anything;
//   * an ARC over each hazard, because following the bolts IS the jump's
//     timing (boltArc rises and comes back down; it teaches, it does not
//     announce);
//   * a COLUMN wherever the answer is up — over a tarp, beside a hoist
//     shaft — since a stack of bolts is the only shape that says "the floor
//     throws you here";
//   * a RUN along every deck the level built, at feet and head height, so
//     climbing is paid for rather than merely permitted; and
//   * bolts PAST the thing the machine clears — you cannot reach those until
//     the bank is dug or the girder is seated, which is the ride's receipt.
//
// Still exactly 100 a room (`check()` refuses ninety-nine under a HUD that
// says a hundred) and still three golden ones off the walking line.
