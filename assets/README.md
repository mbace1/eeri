# EERI — asset drop-in contract

This folder is the seam between the game and the art (ART_BRIEF §2, §4, §5).
The game runs **today** with zero files here — every entry in
`manifest.json` marked `"placeholder"` is built in code. To ship a real
asset:

1. Put the file at the path named in `manifest.json`
   (`assets/2d/…png` or `assets/3d/…glb`).
2. Flip that entry's `"status"` to `"live"`.
3. Bump the manifest `"v"` (it is the cache token on every asset URL).
4. Run `node eeri/test/smoke.cjs` — it fails if a live file is missing or
   a model breaks its node contract.

Nothing else changes. If a live asset fails to load or breaks contract,
the game logs a warning and ships the placeholder — a grey box beats a
broken page, but the smoke gate still fails so it cannot ship silently.

**How the assets are MADE is [`/ART_PIPELINE.md`](../../ART_PIPELINE.md)** —
canonical for concept → mesh → rig → animate → integrate, with the credit
costs and a trap index. Two rules from it that bite here:
- **A Meshy feature is always the primary choice.** It auto-rigs a humanoid
  with a 24-bone skeleton and skin weights for 5 credits and applies any of
  600+ animation clips for 3 each.
- **Anything to be rigged is concepted in a T-POSE.** A limb resting against
  the torso cannot be separated from it, and Meshy's rigger requires clearly
  defined limbs. The pose is a technical requirement of the concept.

**TWO KINDS OF RIG live behind this seam.** A hand-cut model declares the
`nodes` the game rotates. A Meshy auto-rigged character is a **skinned** mesh
declaring the named `clips` it can play — it has a bone skeleton, not the
game's node names. `"rig": "skinned"` picks which contract is checked, and
such an entry also carries `"height"` **in tiles**, because Meshy rigs to
real-world metres and the seam rescales on load. Both come back through the
same `getModel` call, so game code cannot tell them apart.

## 3D models (`assets/3d/*.glb`)

Spec: ART_BRIEF §5. glTF 2.0 single-file GLB · 1 unit = 1 tile · origin at
ground/foot contact · +Y up · **facing +x** · flat normals · vertex colours
or one shared palette-strip texture · no PBR channels · transforms applied.
The game animates **named nodes** (rigid hierarchies, no skinning):

### `eeri_v1.glb` — the kid (≈ 1.5 u tall + hat)
| node | pivot | driven by |
|---|---|---|
| `hipL`, `hipR` | hip joint | run/ride/climb swing (rotation.z) |
| `body` | waist | lean, breath (rotation.z, position.y, scale.y) |
| `armL`, `armR` | shoulder (children of `body`) | swing (rotation.z) |
| `head` | neck | nod/sway (rotation.z) |

### `excavator_v1.glb` — first machine (≈ 3 u long, 2.1 u tall)
| node | pivot | driven by |
|---|---|---|
| `house` | slew centre on deck | idle vibration (position.y) |
| `boom` | house front hinge (child of `house`) | W/S control (rotation.z, rest ≈ 0.52) |
| `stick` | boom end hinge (child of `boom`) | follow (rotation.z, rest ≈ −1.35) |
| `bucket` | stick end hinge (child of `stick`) | working angle (rotation.z, rest ≈ −0.6) |
| `seat` | cab seat base (empty) | Eeri parents here while riding |
| `step` | the climb-up point (empty) | the mount move passes through it |
| `wheels` | group; each child spins about its **local z** | rolling |
| `beacon` | amber lamp, cab roof or rear corner | lit + turning while UNMANNED, dark once Eeri is aboard |

The cab must be open and the seat readable — Eeri stays visible while
riding (the Yoshi rule, ART_BRIEF §3.6), **and the empty seat is how a
player tells an unmanned machine from a tamed one** (§1.2). Draw the seat
to be read from the side at 32 px, empty.

### Manipulable world pieces — `assets/3d/<piece>_v1.glb`

Spec: ART_BRIEF §5.1. Things a machine digs, lifts or breaks. Same GLB
rules as the cast. Each ships **all of its states in one file** as sibling
nodes named `state0`, `state1`, `state2`… (state0 = untouched); the game
shows exactly one at a time, so they must share an origin and register
against each other. A piece that is carried also needs a `grip` node —
the point the bucket or hook takes hold of.

| file | states | notes |
|---|---|---|
| `bank_v1.glb` | `state0` full · `state1` half · `state2` dug flat | half-dug wants a fresh cut face and spill at the foot |
| `girder_v1.glb` | `state0` stacked · `state1` slung · `state2` seated as a span | needs `grip`; the span state is walked on, so its top is flat and 1 tile deep. State origins: `state0` on the ground under the stack centre, `state1` hangs from `grip` at its origin (the game rests the load on the ground when the grip comes down — the rest depth is read off `state1`'s own bounding box), `state2` at the span centre with its top at +1 |
| `wall_v1.glb` | `state0` intact · `state1` cracked · `state2` rubble | rubble is a different silhouette, not a shorter wall |
| `load_v1.glb` | `state0` grounded · `state1` slung · `state2` placed | needs `grip` |

Add the file to `manifest.json` under a `"pieces"` block with the same
`status` / `nodes` shape the models use.

## The title logo (`assets/2d/eeri_logo_v1.png`) — **art's next item**

Owner, 2026-08-14: *"I will ask art to make a logo around the character."*
So this is a **logotype built around Eeri**, not a wordmark beside him —
the character is part of the mark, the way a Yoshi logo has Yoshi in it.

The game ships a plain code-drawn wordmark until this file lands, and swaps
to it the moment `manifest.json` → `ui.logo.status` is flipped to `"live"`
and `v` is bumped. If it 404s the wordmark comes back; nothing breaks.

| thing | spec |
|---|---|
| file | `assets/2d/eeri_logo_v1.png`, PNG with alpha |
| size | **1120 × 440** — the intro caps the logo at 560px wide, so this is 2× for a retina screen |
| safe area | keep the mark inside the **middle 90%**; height is capped at `34vh` as well as in px, and a landscape phone is short |
| ground | it sits on the intro's **sky-blue gradient** (`#4aa8e8` → `#2f86c4`) with **no box behind it**, so it must hold up against blue on its own — INK outline, MACHINE yellow as the fill (ART_BRIEF §3.3) |
| the name | lowercase **`eeri`**, which is how the owner writes it |
| what it must not be | a photo, a gradient, or anything with a drop shadow that assumes a white page. Same two-colour discipline as everything else here |

The story line under it is **text, not art** (`js/lang.js`), because it is
translated into three languages and a picture of a sentence cannot be.

## 2D layers (`assets/2d/*.png`)

Spec: ART_BRIEF §4. **WEBP with alpha** since v15.19 — PNG is still accepted
and the size gate reads both, but a layer is five wide strips of soft craft
render and PNG is the wrong container for that: the v3 groundworks set was
8.5 MB, the day sky alone 4.2 MB, and the same pictures at q0.88 webp are
about a tenth of it. Flat-colour cutout shapes, shading painted in (key light
upper-left), depth tint toward the sky **baked into the painting**
(`LAYER_TINT`: skyline 0.58 · far 0.38 · mid 0.20 · near 0.07 · fore 0).
Each layer is one image covering a fixed world rect. **Resolution is no
longer one number** (v15.23): it follows how close the lane is to the camera,
because that is what decides whether the painting is magnified on screen.

| layer | z | world rect (x0…x1 × y0…y1) | PNG size | px/unit |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `sky` | −48 | −60…170 × −6…40 | 4096 × 1380 * | ~18 |
| `skyline` | −30 | −30…130 × 0…30 | 4096 × 900 * | ~26 |
| `far` | −14 | −20…120 × 0…20 | 4096 × 600 * | ~29 |
| `mid` | −6 | −12…110 × 0…14 | 4096 × 470 | ~34 |
| `near` | −2 | −8…104 × 0…8 | 4096 × 293 | ~37 |
| `fore` | +2.2 | −8…104 × −2…14 | 4096 × 585 | ~37 |

\* canvas width is capped at 4096 px; the plane stretches it to the rect,
so paint to 4096 wide and treat the horizontal scale as slightly coarse —
these layers are far away.

**Why the close lanes moved off 30.** On screen the play plane shows at about
57 px per world unit, and the fore lane — magnified by its own depth — at
about 69. Stored at 30, everything near the camera was being displayed at
roughly twice its painted resolution through a `LinearFilter`, which is the
soft, smeared read that reads as "not HD". The close lanes now go to the 4096
cap and no further.

**THE CAP IS NOT NEGOTIABLE.** 4096 is the texture size a modest phone GPU is
guaranteed to accept, and a layer that fails to upload is not a soft layer, it
is a missing one. Over a 112-unit rect that ceiling is 36.6 px/unit — a 22%
linear gain, not the 60% the camera would like. Buying more would mean
splitting a lane across two textures, which is a bigger change than it sounds
and has not been done.

**Pixels stay square.** Each height is the rect's aspect times the width.
Stretching one axis to buy resolution on the other is how a layer starts
reading as smeared in one direction only.

**These numbers are checked.** `eeri/test/smoke.cjs` reads this table and
compares it against `LAYER_RECTS` × `PPU` in `js/layers.js`, and a live layer
whose pixel size does not match its row fails the gate rather than being
silently stretched onto the plane. Paint to the row. Its `imageSize()` reads
PNG IHDR and all three WEBP encodings, so the format is free but the size is
not.

**Where the shipping layers come from.** `art-src/tools/build-worlds.mjs`
composes all four worlds out of `art-src/world-N-library/`, one pool per
world — a world may only draw from its own library, which is the rule that
was missing when World 2 shipped built largely from World 1's pieces. The
ground line each lane stands on is **measured off the code painter** in
`js/layers.js` (its `base` per lane: 3.0 / 3.4 / 3.8 / 3.9, and
`FORE_GROUND` 3.4), because a live layer and its placeholder have to put the
horizon in the same place. Rebuild one world with:

```
NODE_PATH=$(npm root -g) node art-src/tools/build-worlds.mjs groundworks
```

The sky ships as a layer like the rest since v9 — the crafted paper sky
(palette gradient × paper-grain luminance, cotton-wool cloud cutouts, ONE
paper sun) built by `art-src` tooling; `drawSky` stays as its code
placeholder. A naively tiled prop sheet grows a second sun — the sun is
cropped out and stamped once.

### What each layer is FOR (v4 — the depth pass)

The stack is not five pictures at five distances; each one has a job, and
a layer that does another layer's job flattens the diorama:

- **`skyline`** — quiet. Low internal contrast, heavily hazed. It sets the
  city and then gets out of the way. Crisp two-tone blocks here read as
  *near* and fight the playfield; that is a bug, not a style.
- **`far`** — the half-built frames. Structure you read as distance.
- **`mid`** — the built stage: scaffold bays, hoarding, the SMB3
  flats conceit showing its bolts.
- **`near`** — dressing just behind the action; it may overlap the
  playfield's silhouette, that is what sells the lane.
- **`fore`** — **the occluder lane, and it must be CROPPED.** Every piece
  here runs off the top or the bottom of the rect. Narrow verticals you
  pass behind (scaffold standards), low sweeps along the bottom (spoil,
  drums), and high crossings (a pipe run). Dark, near-silhouette, no sky
  tint. Two rules learned the hard way: a big shape parked at eye level is
  a blob with the game hidden behind it, and a heap whose crest sits below
  the playfield's ground line (y = 4) reads as a hole cut in the earth
  rather than a mound in front of it.

## Sources

Working files (`.blend`, `.aseprite`, `.svg`, `.kra`) go in `eeri/art-src/`,
not here — this folder ships. Keep exports optimised: GLB < 400 KB,
layer PNGs indexed/flattened where the tool allows.
