# The art pipeline — concept to shipped asset

**Canonical. This supersedes the scattered notes in `eeri/art-src/MESHY.md`,
`eeri/assets/README.md` and the per-project sheets.** Those still hold
*project-specific* material (contracts, rosters, style blocks); this holds the
method.

Every rule below was paid for. Where a rule exists, the failure that bought it
is named, because a rule without its failure gets "improved" away by the next
session.

---

## 0. The rule that governs the rest

**A Meshy feature is always the primary choice. Look up what Meshy offers
BEFORE building anything, and only build where Meshy has no feature.**

This is the owner's direction and it exists because it was learned the
expensive way. One session built a mesh slicer, a cut-plane authoring tool, a
hole-capper, a bind-rotation system and a joint-swing test — several hundred
lines and four wrong turns — to give one character an arm that moved. Meshy
rigs a humanoid with a 24-bone skeleton and skin weights for **5 credits in
about a minute**, and returns walk and run clips in the same response.

`docs.meshy.ai` is the source of truth and this list goes stale. Re-read it
before starting anything.

| feature | endpoint | for |
|---|---|---|
| Text to 3D | `/openapi/v2/text-to-3d` | prompt → textured model |
| Image to 3D | `/openapi/v1/image-to-3d` | one concept image → textured model |
| **Multi-Image to 3D** | `/openapi/v1/multi-image-to-3d` | **2–8 views conditioned together**, texturing driven from all of them |
| **Auto Rigging** | `/openapi/v1/rigging` | **skeleton + skin weights**; returns walk + run free |
| **Animation** | `/openapi/v1/animations` | **600+ clip library** onto a rigged character |
| Retexture | `/openapi/retexture/v1` | **repaint an existing model** from a prompt; PBR to 8K |
| UV Unwrap | `/openapi/uv-unwrap/v1` | UV layout for an existing model |
| Remesh / Convert / Resize | `/openapi/v1/remesh`, `/convert`, `/resize` | polycount, topology, format, scale |
| Retopology | (product) | clean quad/tri topology, 3K–100K |
| Text to Image / Image to Image | `/openapi/text-to-image/v1` | Meshy's own concept art, tuned for 3D |
| Printability, Creative Lab | various | 3D-print prep, novelty products — unused here |

**Every stage ends in a picture, and the picture is the gate.** The one time
this was skipped, a character shipped with 8/8 contracted nodes, a passing
49-check gate, and an arm across his face. A contract check cannot see a
picture. Neither can a triangle count.

## Stage 1 — Concept (Nano Banana)

    node concept.mjs "<prompt>" --model gemini-3-pro-image --ar 1:1 \
         [--ref approved.jpg] --out out/<proj> --name <stem>

### The T-pose rule

**Anything that will be rigged is drawn in a T-POSE. Always.** Not "usually",
not "A-pose is fine". A mesh is rigged from where its geometry sits in space,
so a limb resting against the body cannot be separated from it — a character
drawn standing naturally arrives with its arms fused to its ribs, and Meshy's
rigger explicitly requires "clearly defined limbs". The pose is a **technical
requirement of the concept**, not something fixed later.

- Arms **straight out horizontal**, like the crossbar of a T.
- Background visible through **each armpit** and **between the legs**.
- Nothing overlapping anything.

### …but the pose is the SECOND thing the rigger looks at

**A perfect T-pose does not make a riggable model. A HUMAN BODY does.** This
cost two rejected rigs before it was understood, and the evidence is in this
repo:

- A bolt-bot in a strict T-pose, daylight through both armpits and between the
  legs, was rejected: *"Pose estimation failed, please provide a valid model."*
- Redrawn with textbook human proportions — visible neck, shoulders wider than
  hips, arms as long as the legs, elbows and knees halfway — **rejected again**.
- `eeri/art-src/E1-eeri-tpose.jpg`, which rigged first time, has his **legs
  merged at the hip with no daylight at all** and his arms barely 40° from his
  sides.

The difference is not the pose and not the proportions: it is **volume**. Eeri
is a solid toy with mass — a rounded torso, limbs that taper *out of* it, real
mitten hands. Both failed bots were stick figures: tubes stuck onto a box. The
estimator is looking for a body it can fit a skeleton *inside*, and there is
nothing inside a tube.

So for anything non-human — a robot, a creature, a mascot — **build it on a
body that has already rigged**. `--ref` the approved character for BODY PLAN
and disown its costume in words (*"copy only the body plan and the chunky
solid proportions; do not copy the clothes, face, hair or colours"*). The
third bolt-bot did exactly that and rigged first time. Be a robot in the
**faceplate and the surface**, never in the construction.

**"T-pose" is a far stronger instruction than "A-pose."** Four attempts at
"arms abducted 45 degrees" came back with the arms hanging at the sides; "both
arms stretched out straight and horizontal, pointing left and right to the
edges of the frame, like the crossbar of a letter T" worked first time. The
model treats "A-pose" as a hint and "T-pose" as a spec.

### Keeping the character across a re-pose

`--ref <image>` attaches an approved concept. **Use it** — a pose change
described in words alone comes back a different character.

But **the reference dominates the pose**. Passing the approved concept and
asking for a T-pose returns the original pose every time. Name the image a
**costume swatch** explicitly:

> The attached image is a COLOUR AND COSTUME SWATCH ONLY. Do NOT copy its
> pose. Copy only the face, the [garments], and the flat matte finish.
> IGNORE ITS POSE ENTIRELY.

Always re-pose **from the approved concept**, never from the original brief.

### Camera

**Dead front-on hides anything that runs front-to-back.** Eeri's four cap
spikes march back along the crown, so a front view shows exactly one — and
that single view is all the mesher gets to infer a head from, so the mesh came
back with a nub where the silhouette key should be. Turn the figure **~25°**
and **lift the camera** a little; the T-pose survives and the crown reads.

Better still, generate a **turnaround** and use **Multi-Image to 3D** (below).
That is the real fix and it is a built-in.

### What every prompt needs

- single subject, **full body in frame**, generous empty margin
- plain flat background (mid grey), **no cast shadow** — a cast shadow gets
  meshed as geometry
- flat even lighting, no rim light, no bloom
- explicit "no dirt, no grime, no scratches, no weathering, no rust"
- the project's style block appended verbatim (see the per-project sheets)

### Disqualifiers — do not push these to Meshy

- **Thin, spindly or floating parts.** Spider legs, detached spikes, wisps.
  Meshy webs them together or drops them. Ask for "thick", "chunky",
  "fused to the body" variants.
- **Deep interior cavities that matter.** An open maw reads; a hollow ring
  comes back solid.
- **A silhouette that needs colour to read.** Squint at 10%. If you cannot
  name it from the outline, the game cannot either.
- **Painted-on detail pretending to be geometry.** Flat decal eyes are fine
  (re-lit in engine); armour plates that are only painted will disappoint.

---

## Stage 2 — Mesh

    node meshy.mjs image <concept.jpg> --raw --lowpoly \
         --polycount 6000 --topology triangle --out out/<proj> --name <stem>

### `--raw` is not optional for flat palettes

`remove_lighting` and `image_enhancement` **both default TRUE** and both wreck
a flat colour scheme — the first flattens the value range, the second
re-grades the input. Everything asked to "glow" in Hyper Dagger came back
**pink**. `--raw` sets both false. Eeri's navy and olive survive with it on.

### Prefer Multi-Image to 3D when the silhouette has depth

`multi-image-to-3d` "conditions on all of your input views together and drives
texturing from them". Feed front + 3/4 + side + back. **This is the correct
fix for detail that a single view foreshortens away** — reach for it before
fighting the camera angle.

### Meshy adds grime

"No rust, no grime" survives the concept and dies in the mesh; a generated
excavator came back weathered and a generated kid came back with mottled skin
and blotchy trousers, against a brief demanding flat toy paint. **The fix is
`Retexture`** — repaint the existing model from a prompt — **not regenerating
the mesh.** That is a built-in and it was missed for a whole session.

---

## Stage 3 — Rig

### Characters: Meshy's auto-rigger. Always.

    node eeri/art-src/tools/meshyrig.mjs rig <image-to-3d-task-id> <heightMeters>

5 credits, about a minute. Returns `rigged.glb` plus **walk and run for free**.

Input requirements — and the T-pose rule exists to satisfy the third:

- GLB, **textured**, under **300k faces**
- **bipedal humanoid with clearly defined limbs**
- **facing +Z** (glTF forward). Meshy's own image-to-3D output already is.
  **Do not pre-rotate toward the game's facing** or the skeleton comes out
  sideways — rotate at the root when you mount it.

The skeleton is Mixamo-style, 24 bones:

    Hips  Spine Spine01 Spine02  neck Head head_end headfront
    LeftUpLeg LeftLeg LeftFoot LeftToeBase          (and Right…)
    LeftShoulder LeftArm LeftForeArm LeftHand       (and Right…)

`LeftForeArm` is the **elbow**, `LeftLeg` the **knee**. It is **skinned**, so
a bent joint deforms instead of parting company — no cut faces, no caps, no
hollow limb at extreme angles.

### Machines: `slice.mjs`, because they are not bipedal

Meshy's rigger does not handle them. `eeri/art-src/tools/slice.mjs` cuts one
fused mesh into contracted nodes by testing each triangle's centroid:

    node slice.mjs inspect <file.glb> [yaw] [x|y]   # measured grid to author cuts from
    node slice.mjs check <rig>                      # cuts colour-coded + pivot dots
    node slice.mjs cut <rig>                        # write the rigged GLB
    node rigview.mjs <rigged.glb>                   # contract + three real poses
    node swingtest.mjs <rigged.glb> <node>          # PROVE each joint moves

Set `MESHY_WORK` to the work tree holding `node_modules/` and `out/`.

Non-obvious things it has to do, all learned by shipping the broken version:

- **A figure normalises by HEIGHT, a machine by LENGTH.** On one rule a
  standing figure came out 1.4 units tall and walked off the inspect frame.
- **Face +x with a ROTATION, never a mirror.** A mirror reverses triangle
  winding and renders the model inside-out, and it puts the cab on the wrong
  side.
- **Bake the rig's scale into the geometry, not onto the root.** The game
  parents Eeri into `seat` at runtime; a scaled root made him 2.9× life size.
- **Cap the cut faces.** A sliced piece is an open shell and the first joint
  to swing shows the inside of a hollow leg.
- **A wheel is a circle.** Cut with a horizontal plane it comes out sawn in
  half, the bottom spinning and the top left on the chassis.
- **Test priority and parent order are different orders.** `bucket` must be
  tested before `stick` (specific first) and built after it (parent first).
- **`rest` and `bind` are different rotations.** `rest` is a pose on the
  driven node, inherited by children — folding a boom folds the stick and
  bucket. `bind` corrects how the part was *modelled* and goes on an inner
  holder wrapping the geometry only. **Using `rest` where `bind` is meant
  silently does nothing** (see the trap index).

### Never run `gltf-transform optimize` on a rig

Its join/prune passes merge the scene graph and **silently destroy every node
name** — 8/8 nodes to 0/8, and the model would have loaded and been refused.
Use the surgical commands `resize` then `webp`.

---

## Stage 4 — Animate

    node meshyrig.mjs anim <rig-task-id> <actionId> <name>

3 credits each from a **600+ clip library**. Categories: DailyActions,
WalkAndRun, Fighting, BodyMovements (climbing, jumping, vaulting, hanging,
falling), Dancing. Rough id ranges: idle 0/11/12/243–254 · walking 1/30/106–124
· running 14–16/509–539 · jumping 460–472 · climbing 434–449 · sitting 32–33/
52–60/344–372.

Clips are authored by animators, so the counter-swing, the elbow pump and the
jump anticipation are simply present. **Do not hand-author what the library
has.**

`post_process` supports `change_fps` (24/25/30/60), `fbx2usdz` and
`extract_armature`.

---

## Stage 5 — Integrate (three.js)

- **`MeshStandardMaterial` renders BLACK in an unlit scene.** Several projects
  here render with no lights (`MeshBasicMaterial`, `NoToneMapping`). Convert
  every imported material on load to `MeshBasicMaterial` or
  `MeshLambertMaterial`, carrying `map` and `color` across.
- **Vendor `GLTFLoader` and match the version.** It must match the vendored
  `three.module.min.js` REVISION exactly.
- **Clone skinned meshes with `SkeletonUtils.clone`.** A plain `.clone()`
  shares the skeleton, and every copy ends up in whatever frame was sampled
  last.
- **Bump the module's `?v=` token when and only when its bytes change**, and
  write it into every importer. A precache list one token behind the page is
  an app that loads online and is blank on a plane.
- **The asset seam**: `assets/manifest.json` + `js/assets.js`. Every model
  swaps from code placeholder to file with a one-word edit against a node
  contract. A live asset that fails to load or breaks contract logs a warning
  and ships the placeholder — but the smoke gate still fails, so it cannot
  ship silently.

---

## Verification — what actually catches things

| check | catches | why the obvious thing missed it |
|---|---|---|
| Render **LARGE** beside the concept | the whole class of "that isn't the character" | the only picture taken was gameplay-size, where the kid is 40 px |
| **32-px silhouette** alongside | detail that only exists at poster size | dino spikes and a tee print are sub-pixel on a 1.5-unit figure |
| **`swingtest.mjs`** on every driven joint | a joint that does not move | the render looked completely plausible — the arm was in a *believable* place, just always the same one |
| **Animation across frames**, not one still | a dead cycle, a march instead of a run | a settled single frame cannot show a counter-swing |
| Node-contract check | a missing node | necessary, **not sufficient** — see the top of this section |

**A passing contract is not a passing asset.**

---

## Costs

| step | credits |
|---|---|
| Nano Banana concept | free |
| image-to-3D | 30 |
| multi-image-to-3D | 30 |
| remesh (vs regenerating) | 5 |
| **auto-rig** (incl. walk + run) | **5** |
| **library animation** | **3** |

A complete character — concept, mesh, rig, idle/walk/run/jump/sit — is
**41 credits**. Instance repeatable assets rather than regenerating them.

---

## Trap index

Every one of these shipped or nearly shipped.

**Concept**
1. "A-pose" is read as a hint. Say T-pose.
2. A `--ref` image drags its pose along. Call it a costume swatch and disown
   the pose explicitly.
3. A dead-front view loses front-to-back silhouette. Turn 25°, lift the
   camera, or use multi-image.
4. A cast shadow in the concept becomes geometry in the mesh.

**Mesh**
5. `remove_lighting` / `image_enhancement` default TRUE and wash out flat
   palettes. Use `--raw`.
6. Meshy adds grime the prompt forbade. Fix with **Retexture**, not a re-roll.
7. Per-part generation makes a bobblehead: a generated head and torso come
   back the same size, so scaling each to its own declared length destroys
   proportion. Generate the whole figure.

**Rig**
8. `gltf-transform optimize` destroys every node name.
9. A scaled root is inherited by anything the game parents in at runtime.
10. A mirror reverses winding and renders inside-out.
11. **`rest` vs `bind`.** three.js composes euler XYZ as `Rx·Ry·Rz`, so a
    correction set on the driven node is applied *after* the game's angle, not
    before. A T-posed arm then spins on its own axis: it hangs correctly, the
    render looks right, and the hand never moves. Corrections go on an inner
    holder.
12. Pre-rotating a mesh to the game's facing breaks Meshy's rigger, which
    wants +Z.

**Chroma key and composition** (the 2D 80%, `eeri/art-src/tools/keylib.js`)
13. **Keying on levels under-keys.** `r > 140 && b > 140 && g < 110` is a test
    for BRIGHT magenta, and the model casts a SHADOW on the backing — dark
    magenta near (90, 15, 90) passes none of it and ships as a purple block.
14. **Keying on a ratio alone over-keys.** `g < min(r,b) × 0.8` is true of JPEG
    chroma noise in any dark passage, which punches black speckle through the
    middle of the art. Demand an absolute floor and a real separation as well.
15. **A keyed pixel keeps its original colour behind alpha 0**, and canvas
    scaling averages rgb across the alpha edge — so a piece composited at half
    size grows a magenta fringe out of pixels that are supposedly invisible.
    Bleed the opaque colour a few pixels outward BEFORE anything scales it.
    This is the real cause of the "pink on the clouds" family; no threshold
    tuning reaches it.
16. **A blanket de-magenta greys out the palette.** The backing bounces onto
    what it lights, so neutrals come back salmon — but orange sits on the
    magenta side of the green-magenta axis too, and scores just as high.
    Correct per piece, sized off that piece's own measured mean.
17. **Tiling one segment is not composition.** One good segment stamped across
    a rect gives three identical buildings per screen at one height with dead
    air between them, and no amount of improving the segment fixes it.
    Generate a POOL of single objects and compose: varied heights, rare heroes
    that break the height line, advance as a FRACTION of the piece width so
    pieces overlap, clearings placed deliberately rather than falling out of
    the pitch.
18. **A backdrop grade does not plant anything.** Drawn only behind the
    pieces, a ground line leaves every cutout standing on air — "it stops
    abruptly / isn't connected to ground". Run the same strip AGAIN in front
    at half height so the feet are buried, and drop a contact shadow.
19. **The depth tint flattens the value structure.** Mixing every lane toward
    one pale sky lands them all at the same value, and the player disappears
    into it. Step each lane down from the one behind it, push each lane's
    contrast back up before the tint, and keep a block of local colour in the
    lane directly behind the play lane.

**Surfaces and detail maps**
20. **A detail map must TILE, which means it must be FEATURELESS.** The house
    craft block names split pins and masking tape, so a section generated with
    it comes back with fixings in specific places — correct for a piece, fatal
    for a map. At a 3-unit repeat you can count the same pin forty-five times.
    `detailmap.mjs --highpass` removes a pin or a tape patch; nothing removes
    a photograph of a specific *assemblage*, where the arrangement is the
    subject. **The test is TILE IT 3×3 AND LOOK** — a single patch of an
    untileable map reads as perfectly convincing material.
21. **Decorating a straight boundary makes it worse.** A torn-card strip laid
    along a band boundary turns one straight line into a regular row of
    identical bumps. A boundary wants to be irregular in POSITION — interlock
    the two sides in geometry, which costs no asset.
22. **Mirroring a strip to make it tile makes every tile symmetric**, so a run
    of them reads as a chain of identical scallops. Among grass tufts or torn
    fibres a hard seam is far less visible than perfect bilateral symmetry.
23. **Detail that is not in the visible band is not detail.** Forty-six keyed
    cutouts were placed below the bottom of the frame — loaded, lit, rendered,
    never seen. Check where the camera actually looks before placing anything.

**Integrate**
24. `MeshStandardMaterial` is black in an unlit scene.
25. A plain `.clone()` of a skinned mesh shares the skeleton.
26. A `?v=` token that did not move when the bytes did.

**Process**
27. Verifying the contract and the gate, and never looking at the asset.
28. **A screenshot is not the asset.** A layer looks fine in a 1280px frame and
    is five copies of one picture across its full width. Render the WHOLE
    thing at its real size and look at that too.
29. Building a tool for something Meshy already does. **Check first.**
30. **Treating shipped art as approved art.** Live on `gh-pages` means
    somebody deployed it, not that it meets `ART_TARGET.md`. The v6
    reconciliation kept the deployed vector-cartoon layers by default while
    on-target crafted concepts sat unbuilt — every asset is judged against
    the target doc, whoever shipped it and however long it has been live.
31. **Two instances, unrelated histories.** Fetch and diff `origin/gh-pages`
    and `origin/main` before building on anything; reconcile before new work,
    splitting by kind — code from whichever lineage is ahead, art re-judged
    against the target (see trap 30 and CLAUDE.md "Two instances, one canon").
